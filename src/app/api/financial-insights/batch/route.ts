You are a financial analysis AI that will analyze transaction data and produce multiple financial insights in a single response.
You will need to generate FOUR separate analyses:

1. ACCOUNT HEALTH SNAPSHOT:
- Current balance across all accounts
- Income vs spending (last 30 days) with percentages
- Top 3 spending categories with amounts and percentages
- Financial health rating (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent) with detailed explanation
- Month-over-month spending trend

2. UNUSUAL SPENDING DETECTION:
- Transactions that are significantly larger than usual in the same category
- Unusual merchants or spending categories compared to typical pattern
- Potential duplicate charges with exact same amount within 48 hours
- Spending spikes on particular dates

3. FAST FOOD SPENDING ANALYSIS:
- Total fast food spending with monthly breakdown
- Top 3 fast food merchants with spending amounts
- Day of week patterns (when spending occurs most)
- Average transaction amount
- Percentage of overall food budget
- Three specific saving tips with projected monthly savings

4. SUBSCRIPTION ANALYSIS:
- Detailed list of all likely subscriptions with monthly cost and annual projection
- Total monthly and annual subscription costs
- Categories of subscriptions (entertainment, productivity, etc.)
- Optimization suggestions with specific savings amounts

IMPORTANT: Your output must be visually appealing with rich formatting using markdown and emoji indicators:

VISUAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use extensive color-coded emoji indicators:
  * üî¥ for negative/concerning items (high spending, over budget, etc.)
  * üü¢ for positive items (savings, under budget, good habits)
  * üü† for neutral or warning items
  * üîµ for informational items
  * üí∞ for money amounts
  * üìä for percentages and trends
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è for alerts and warnings
  * ‚úÖ for recommendations and action items
  * üí∏ for spending categories
  * üìÜ for date-related information
  * üìà for increases
  * üìâ for decreases

- Use markdown formatting extensively:
  * ## for main headings
  * ### for section headings
  * ** for bold important figures
  * Use tables with aligned columns
  * Use bullet points and numbered lists
  * Format currency values consistently
  * Include dividers (--- or ***) between major sections
  * Use > blockquotes for summary sections

- Visual organization:
  * Group related information
  * Use white space effectively
  * Highlight key metrics 
  * Make critical alerts stand out
  * Create a visual hierarchy

IMPORTANT: Your output must be formatted in multiple markdown sections separated by "<<<SECTION_BREAK>>>" markers.
Each section should contain ONE of the analyses listed above in this exact order:
1. Account Health Snapshot
2. Unusual Spending Detection
3. Fast Food Spending
4. Subscription Analysis

Ensure each section is self-contained, comprehensive, visually appealing, and ready to be displayed separately.

### Current Balance
- Main Account: **$12,458.92**
- Overall Financial Status: üü¢ Good

### Income vs Spending (Last 30 Days)
- Income: **$8,250.00**
- Spending: **$5,893.45**
- Net Flow: **+$2,356.55**
- Savings Rate: **28.6%**

### Top Spending Categories
| Category | Amount | Percentage |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Housing | **$2,450.00** | 41.6% |
| Groceries | **$845.32** | 14.3% |
| Transportation | **$635.78** | 10.8% |

### Financial Health Assessment
üü¢ **Good**

Your family has a positive cash flow and healthy savings rate above 25%. Your emergency fund covers approximately 3 months of expenses, which is on the right track but could be improved to reach the recommended 6-month level.

### Monthly Trend
Your spending has decreased by **8.3%** compared to last month, primarily due to reduced discretionary purchases.`,
  
  "detective": `## Unusual Spending Detected

### üö® High Priority Alerts

1. **Duplicate Subscription Charge**
   - Date: February 15, 2025
   - Merchant: Spotify Premium Family
   - Amount: **$16.99**
   - Risk Level: Medium
   
   This appears to be a duplicate charge for the same service on the same day. You're normally charged once monthly for this subscription.

2. **Unusually Large Auto Repair**
   - Date: January 16, 2025
   - Merchant: Auto Repair Specialists Engine
   - Amount: **$1,842.37**
   - Risk Level: Low
   
   This expense is 876% higher than your usual automotive expenses which average **$210.25** per transaction.

### üîç Other Unusual Transactions

1. **Medical Expense Spike**
   - Date: March 15, 2025
   - Merchant: Emerg Room Visit Memorial Hosp
   - Amount: **$1,250.00**
   - Risk Level: Low
   
   This is significantly higher than your typical medical expenses.

### Security Recommendations

1. Contact Spotify customer service about the duplicate charge
2. Set up purchase alerts for transactions over $500
3. Review all subscription charges monthly to catch unwanted renewals or duplicates`,
